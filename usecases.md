# AR Use Case Categories

Main AR use cases to categorize AR scenarios:
- [AR Use Case Categories](#ar-use-case-categories)
  - [Spatial Presentation](#spatial-presentation)
  - [Reality Capturing](#reality-capturing)
  - [Anchored Complement](#anchored-complement)
  - [Paint The World](#paint-the-world)
  - [Virtual Try-on](#virtual-try-on)
  - [Contextual Design](#contextual-design)
  - [Immersive Site Navigation](#immersive-site-navigation)
  - [Situated Analytics](#situated-analytics)
  - [Spatio-temporal Workflow](#spatio-temporal-workflow)
  - [Spatial Collaboration](#spatial-collaboration)

These main AR use case categories do list examples which can serve as ideas and titles of AR scenarios.


## Spatial Presentation 
- Contextual object presentation (e.g., product advertising)
- Spatial media presentation: infinite canvas, infinite screen, virtual big screen (with spaial audio)
- Immersive Design Review

## Reality Capturing 
Capture space and objects in real environmet
- Distance Measuring
- Room Scanning/Capturing
- Product Structure Recognition

## Anchored Complement
Annotate existing real objects
- Spatial information annotating / embedding
- Real Object Enrichment
- Text label translation
- Contextualized Documentation
- content augmentation, Magic enrichment, magic book: Paper/image to 3D vis, marker popup, emerging 3D model
- Visualization of the hidden: Mapping unobservable or invisible phenomena into the real world

## Paint The World 
Decorate the world
- Draw on world
- Sketch in air (scribble in air/ draw in air)
- Form a path
- Walk a trail
- Colorize the world : Colorize/Texture object
- Ornament an area: AR lenses, filter effects, particle systems in area
- Sculp a form

## Virtual Try-on 
Show new virtual object fitted on body
- Virtual Eyewear Try-on
- Virtual Shoe Try-on 
- Virtual Cloth Try-on
- Virtual Cosmetic Try-on

## Contextual Design
- present product variants in space
- Product configuration in spatial context
- Product customization within spatial constraints
- Product layouting in space: arrange and configure virtual objects

## Immersive Site Navigation 
Geo-referenced outdoor navigation and contextual indoor navigation
- Spatial referencing: pointing to location, virtual cue
- Virtual guides, navigation and guidances, tour guide
- Virtual Landmarks
- World-in-Miniature, scaled world, Minimap
- find my thing via Tracker location: rfid, UWB

## Situated Analytics
- Data Grafiti: Visualize data in spatial context
- Real-Time Data Overlay (from IoT sensors)

## Spatio-temporal Workflow 
- Contectualized task guidance: assembly guidance in space
- In-situ inspection, maintenance and repair
- Spatio-temporal instructions

## Spatial Collaboration 
- Collaborative, In-World Creation
- Remote Assistance in AR/XR
- AR Whiteboarding
- On-site /remote Collaboration
