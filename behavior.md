# Behavior Patterns


| Behavioral Pattern	| Description	| Example |
|---|---|---|
| Immediate Reaction Pattern	| Direct execution of task triggered by invocation event	| Immediate, singular command of task or function call |
| Timed Reaction Pattern	| Temporally executed action	| Delayed action, timed action sequence|
| Conditional Reaction Pattern	| Execute an action only when a condition is fulfilled after being triggered by event	| State-driven, asynchronous programming logic|
| Continous Evaluation Pattern	| Continous polling of state change	|Existence check, visibility check, proximity check, repeated update checks |
| Publish-Subscribe Notification Pattern	| Receive notifications via a message queue from a subscribed system	| In FaceTime/SharePlay call, in Bluetooth connection, in WebSocket/WebRTC session |
| Request Response Pattern	| Remote procedure call resulting in asynchronously receiving ECA rules or media assets	| REST API call via a Web URL to load rules or assets (images, 3D models), e.g., `GET:JSON` or `POST:CONTEXT`|
| Chain Reaction Pattern	| Course of events processed as sequence of indirect reactions	| Rule changing data that will trigger a rule to update an itemâ€™s visual as a follow-up |
| Complementary Reactions Pattern	| Two reactions with opposite result	|Reacting on toggling states with two complementary active rules|
| Detector Reactivation Pattern	| Reactivate detector with only once reaction	|Reactivate detector after resulting augmentation is no longer existing |
