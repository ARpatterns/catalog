# Ahead Staging Pattern

Ahead staging is a technique for presenting 3D content in a way that it is aligned to spectator’s position and view direction. The scene is launched at a default distance (1–2m) in front of the user using a world-locked anchor, often relative to the ground floor plane. The alignment can be directed towards geolocated references (e.g., as a guide as in Fig. 15b), towards the user (Fig. 15c), or can also consider nearby objects in the environment (e.g., a wall as in Fig. 15dorthe room axis). After the initial staging, users can interact with the virtual scene from their current position or move toward and around the staged content.
