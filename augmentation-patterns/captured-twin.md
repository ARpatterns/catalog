# Captured Twin Pattern

A captured twin is a virtual replica of a physical element. It is created using data collected from sensors, cameras, and other sources. A captured twin can then, for example, be virtually visualized as a contour or as a transparent 3D bounding box to keep the real object recognizable. In the image [Alignment of Augmentations in 3D (with object)](ahead-staging.md#alignment-of-augmentations-in-3d), a real-world chair has been detected as an object and is indicated with a virtual bounding box and a text label of the object type. A captured twin may also have no virtual representation but becomes available in the spatial data model (e.g., for collision detection or as a reference for spatial alignment).
