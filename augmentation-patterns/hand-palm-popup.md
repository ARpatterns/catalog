# Hand/Palm Pop-Up Pattern

The hand/palm pop-up is a prevalent design pattern used to present interaction elements for AR using head-mounted displays. Rather than constantly displaying these elements, they are shown only when the palm or back of the hand is visible (and optionally, when a hand gesture was detected beforehand). The other hand can then be used to interact with the presented 3D UI elements. An example is the ‘Hand Menu’ UX component of the [Mixed Reality Toolkit](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/mixed-reality/mrtk-unity/mrtk3-overview).
