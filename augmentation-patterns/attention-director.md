# Attention Director Pattern

An attention director uses animated pointers (bubbles, arrows), light rays, or spatial sound to direct where users should pay attention if the relevant area is not visible or not in focus.

* _Placed_: initially ahead of user
* _Aligned_: pointing towards point of interest
