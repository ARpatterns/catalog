# Superimposition Pattern

Superimposition aims to cover a detected entity with a virtual one rather than simply supplementing it. For example, if an image is detected, it could be covered with a downloaded image, or if an object is recognized, it could be replaced with a virtual 3D object that hides the real one.

* _Placed_: on object
* _Aligned_: with object
