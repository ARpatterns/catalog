# Segment Overlay Pattern

By utilizing computer vision and machine learning techniques, a segment detector can recognize and track designated landmarks and image segments. The outcomes of the image segmentation process may include:

* point (pixel): room corner, object corner, pupil center, ...
* edge: horizon line, wall-floor edge, ...
* bounding box: depicting rectangle border of detected text, image, face, ...
* path (open path): eyebrow, body skeleton, ...
* contour (closed path): face, mouth, eye, ...
* image mask: sky, grass, hair, ...

In the AR view, the overlay is positioned based on the pixels relative to the segment within the 2D image, on top of the video stream.
