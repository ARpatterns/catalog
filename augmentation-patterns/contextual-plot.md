# Contextual Plot Pattern

A contextual plot combines a variety of augmentation patterns and behavioural patterns to create a non-linear and immersive experience. It builds a scenography that blends seamlessly with the spatio-temporal setting of the real world. A contextual plot reacts to diverse event types, triggering rules that will dynamically control interactive and animated reactions. One of the defining features of a contextual plot is its dependence on the real-world context. The experience is affected by how the user is interacting with and exploring the scenario.
