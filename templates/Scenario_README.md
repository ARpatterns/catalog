## AR Patterns

{Hint: List of used behavior and augmentation patterns. Link the patterns to their catalog references as shown in the samples below}

__Behavior Pattern__

* [Instant Reaction](https://github.com/ARpatterns/catalog/blob/main/behavioral-patterns/instant-reaction.md): Immediate execution of the staging ahead action
  * _Event_: on start {Hint: [Events](https://github.com/ARpatterns/catalog/blob/main/eca/events.md)}

__Augmentation Pattern__
* [Ahead Staging](https://github.com/ARpatterns/catalog/blob/main/augmentation-patterns/ahead-staging.md): presenting 3D object `red.box` 1.5 m  in front of the user.
  * _Placed_: initial ahead of the user on the floor.
  * _Aligned_: initial towards the user in view direction.
  * _Pivot_ {optional}: Objects in the local coordinate system are centered on the ground floor. If the object is rotated around the AR anchor in the world coordinate system, it turns by it's center up axis.

## ECA Diagram {optional but recommended}
