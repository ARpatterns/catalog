# Conditional Reaction Pattern

An ECA ruleâ€™s condition is tested on the data available in the current AR session at the time of evaluation. The outcome of the condition evaluation is either true or false. Only if true the action of the ECA rule will be executed. In addition, a conditional reaction can be combined with a timed reaction. Together, these reactions form the core of the [continuous evaluation pattern](continous-evaluation.md).
