Catalog of AR Patterns: Event-driven Design Patterns in Creating Augmented Reality Experiences

## Introduction

Augmented Reality (AR) and Mixed Reality (MR) enable superimposing digital content onto the real world.
Design patterns are a widely accepted concept for documenting proven solutions to recurring design problems. 
AR patterns are encompassing fundamental concepts for crafting immersive AR experiences.

## Event-Condition-Action Pattern

Event-Condition-Action rules are leveraged as a generic abstraction from the reactive behavior of AR software systems to establish a unified framework. AR-specific behavioral patterns and augmentation patterns are presented in detail.
