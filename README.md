## Introduction

Augmented Reality (AR) and Mixed Reality (MR) enable superimposing digital content onto the real world.
Design patterns are a widely accepted concept for documenting proven solutions to recurring design problems. 
AR patterns are encompassing fundamental concepts for crafting immersive AR experiences.

## Event-Condition-Action Pattern

To design reactive systems, breaking down the system’s behavior into discrete events, conditions, and actions provides a structured and modular approach.

Description of the [ECA Pattern](eca.md)

## Augmentation Patterns

Augmentation intents triggered by detector events and which add augmentation items to the AR scene.

## Behavioral Patterns

Typical patterns for defining the dynamic behavior of AR experiences.
