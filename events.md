# Events Categories in AR Applications

An event is a signal that something has happened. Events are generated by a producer caused and triggered by various circumstances.
Within an Augmented Reality session of ARchi VR the following event types may happen:

| Event Type	| Producer |	Cause	| Time Resolution |
|--- |--- |---|---|
| Session Event	| AR Session	| Change of session state → `on:start, on:stable, on:load, on:error, on:stop`	| in realtime |
| Invocation Event	| Command Initiation or Function Call	| Invocation of task → `on:command, as:once`, function call → `on:call`	| in realtime |
| Detection Event	| Installed Detector	| Discovery of designated entity → `on:detect`	| 100 - 500 ms |
| User Event	| App User	| User interaction → `on:tap, on:press, on:drag, on:select, on:dialog, on:poi`	| in realtime |
| Temporal Event	| Time Scheduler	| Elapsed time in seconds reached → `in:time`	| 200 ms |
| Data-driven Event	| Data Observer & Context Dispatcher	| Observed change of key-value in data model → `as:changed, as:stated, as:steady, as:activated, as:altered, as:always, as:repeated`	| 200 ms| 
| Response Event	| Remote Request	| Async response of REST API call → `do:request`	| 20 - 5’000 ms| 
| Notification Event	| Subscribed System: Bonjour or SharePlay	| Received notification during collaboration → `on:enter, on:leave`; Broadcast task → `as:broadcast`	| 50 - 250 ms |
|


## Session Events

* `on:start`: immediately after start of AR session or after loading action
* `on:locating`: on locating in the world (by GPS, by SLAM device positioning) – on:stable: when spatial registration of AR device gets stable
* `on:load`: after loading 3D item to AR view, e.g., to animate or occlude node – on:stop: before AR session ends
  
## Invocation Events
* `on:command`: on command initiation 
* `on:call`: on function call
  
## User Events
* `on:tap`: when tapped on item
* `on:press`: when long-pressed on item
* `on:drag`: when dragging an item
* `on:select`: when selected from options of pop-up menu
* `on:dialog`: when selected from options of pop-up dialog panel 
* `on:poi`: when selected a point of interest in a map or minimap

## Temporal Events
* `in:time`: when elapsed time in seconds is reached
* `as:always`: several times per seconds
* `as:repeated`: like as:always, but only triggered each seconds

##  Data-driven Events
By using a state machine, both value changes and state transitions can generate data-driven events, taking into account previous values. This dynamic triggering turns ECA to active rules.
* `on:change`: on each change of data value
* `as:stated`: like as:always, but action only is triggered once when if-condition result is altered from false to true
* `as:steady`: like as:stated, but action only is triggered when condition result stays true for a certain time in seconds.
* `as:activated`: like as:always, but action always is triggered when if-condition result becomes true
* `as:altered`: like as:always, but action always is triggered when if-condition result is altered from false to true or from true to false

## Response Events
* `on:response`: on receiving response from request 
* `on:error`: on error of handling request

## Detection Event
* `on:detect`: on detecting occurrence of depicted type
* `on:track`: on tracked changes in occurrence of depicted type

## Notification Events
* `on:voice`: on voice command from speech recognition system
* `on:enter`: on enter of participant in collaboration session
* `on:message`: on message from participant in collaboration session 
* `on:leave`: on leave of participant in collaboration session
