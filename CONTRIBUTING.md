Our goal is to expand and maintain this catalog of AR patterns. For this goal we need you!

# Watch & Follow
To not miss any future announcements "watch" this [repository](https://github.com/ARpatterns/catalog) and follow the organization at https://github.com/ARpatterns.

# Join our Discussions
The [Discussions](https://github.com/orgs/ARpatterns/discussions) is where the ideas start to form into new patterns and changes to the existing catalog are discussed. There are different channels for the different topics. You can also share your own experiences with the patterns in the wild or ask questions to the community.

# Contribute to the Patterns
If you have an idea for a new pattern, start with a discussion in the respective category ([Discussions](https://github.com/orgs/ARpatterns/discussions)). Once the community is more or less of the same opinion, it's time to create your own branch and formulate the pattern. GitHub Docs has an article on how the ["fork and pull request" process](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/exploring-projects-on-github/contributing-to-a-project) works in detail. Once the pull request is created, the community will give feedback and eventually the maintainers will merge it.

# Contribute to the Examples
You have some examples of the patterns in use, you want to share? Follow the ["fork and pull request" process](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/exploring-projects-on-github/contributing-to-a-project) to add it to the examples and link it in the patterns it relates to.

# Share
To grow the community, we need you to spread the word! Do you know someone, who might be interested in this catalog or have some knowledge to contribute, share the link to this community https://arpatterns.dev with them.
