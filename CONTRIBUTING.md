Our goal is to expand and maintain this catalog of AR patterns. For this we need you!

# Watch & Follow
To not miss any future announcements: "watch" this [repository](https://github.com/ARpatterns/catalog) and follow the organization at https://github.com/ARpatterns.

# Join our Discussions
The [Discussions](https://github.com/orgs/ARpatterns/discussions) is where ideas start to form into new patterns, new scenarios, and changes to the existing catalog are discussed. There are different channels for the different topics. You can also share your own experiences with the patterns in the wild or ask questions to the community.

# Contribute to AR Patterns
If you have an idea for a new pattern, a new technolgy platform or changes in the use cases, then start with a discussion in the respective category ([Discussions](https://github.com/orgs/ARpatterns/discussions)). Once the community is positive, it's time to create your own branch and formulate the changes and additions. GitHub Docs has an article on how the ["fork and pull request" process](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/exploring-projects-on-github/contributing-to-a-project) works in detail. Once a pull request is created, the community will give feedback and eventually the maintainers will merge it into the main branch.

# Contribute to AR Scenarios
You have some examples of AR patterns in use which you want to share as open source project implemented with a specific [technology platfrom](https://github.com/ARpatterns/catalog/blob/main/platforms.md)? Then create your own repository and document the used AR patterns according to the proposed [template](https://github.com/ARpatterns/catalog/blob/main/templates/Scenario_README.md). Ask a maintainer to add your contribution to the [AR scenarios](https://github.com/ARpatterns#ar-scenarios---technology-specific-use-cases-of-ar-patterns).

# Share
To grow the community, we need you to spread the word! Do you know someone who might be interested in this catalog or have some expertise to contribute, then please share the link to this https://arpatterns.dev community.
